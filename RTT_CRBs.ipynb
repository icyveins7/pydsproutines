    "# A Primer on RTT Localization CRBs\n",
    "\n",
    "With reference to standard TDOAs, one may choose to localize via return trip timings (RTTs). This is **not** the same as ranging (at least not exactly) as is used in standard GPS systems, but instead involves at least a single 'bounce'. Here we will derive the CRB for this specific single bounce scenario, although multiple bounces should be easily extended from this example.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Measurement of Range\n",
    "\n",
    "In the single bounce scenario, the signal travels from the emitter (here denoted as $E$) and reaches the unknown *reflector* (here denoted as $X$), then to the receiver/sensor (here denoted as $S$). As such the ranging measurement (after conversions from RTT) is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "r = |X - S| + |X - E|\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the above variables are all vectors representing the respective positions. Here we have not assumed that the emitter is the same as the receiver/sensor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the form of this is very similar to the TDOA range measurement:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "r = |X - S_2| - |X - S_1|\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the two $s_i$ represent the pair of sensors/receivers. Hence it is likely that the final form can be worked out in almost identical way.\n",
