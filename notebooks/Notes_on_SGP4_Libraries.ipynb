    "SGP4 is the propagator used strictly with the publicly available TLEs. The original code by the author is provided primarily at the website [here](https://celestrak.org/software/vallado-sw.php), but I have collated a copy in my repository [here](https://github.com/icyveins7/sgp4-download-celestrak) along with some notes about the two different versions available on the website. To make things clear, I will reference the versions of the code I reupload onto my repository: current test is at commit 09142b1.\n",

    "# Coordinate Systems\n",
    "Before we start, it is important to understand the different coordinate systems at play here. The TLEs and the SGP4 propagator are closely intertwined, and both are expected to operate _solely_ in what is known as the __TEME (True Equator Mean Equinox)__ coordinate system.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, for most intents and purposes, we require the __ITRF (International Terrestrial Reference Frame)__, which is a specification of an __ECEF (Earth-Centered Earth-Fixed)__ frame. This conversion from TEME to ITRF is _non-trivial_, and is the part which requires a lot of external input i.e. not just the TLE, but other things known as Earth Orientation Parameters are required.\n",

Notably, it does claim that using WGS84 at this point in the propagator is likely to perform worse when compared to real measurements of satellite positions, due to the TLEs being generated with WGS72 models in mind."

    "2. Skyfield uses the new iau2000a theories in the TEME to ECEF conversions. This can be traced by looking at the ```t.gast()``` call, which seems to lead eventually leads to the ```iau2000a``` call and many other relevant calls in ```nutationlib```. Overtly speaking, this does _not_ appear to be what is done in the C++ code for ```teme_ecef```, which strictly calls a ```gstime()``` function which has been documented as 'iau-82', and despite there being a ```gstime00()``` function which is documented as 'iau-2010', and has comments like ```//  greenwich mean sidereal time, iau 2000.```. It is likely that using this may bring the C++ code in greater agreement with the more current Skyfield code, but the fact that it does not cause any significant agreement error is somewhat puzzling.\n"
