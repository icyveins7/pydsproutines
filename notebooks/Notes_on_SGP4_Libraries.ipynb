    "# Some History\n",
    "SGP4 is the propagator used strictly with the publicly available TLEs. The original code by the author is provided primarily at the website [here](https://celestrak.org/software/vallado-sw.php), but I have collated a copy in my repository [here](https://github.com/icyveins7/sgp4-download-celestrak) along with some notes about the two different versions available on the website. To make things clear, I will reference the versions of the code I reupload onto my repository: current test is at commit 09142b1.\n",
    "\n",
    "This current repository, ```pydsproutines```, also contains some code from the python libraries ```sgp4``` (which is a simple wrapper around the SGP4 library) and ```skyfield``` (which has more functions, and itself wraps the python ```sgp4``` library)."

    "# Comparisons\n",
    "We would like to compare the results of the same propagation in the above libraries, bearing in mind that the calling structure is different; if the inputs required are different, we would like to determine what is required to make the results the same, if any."

    "# Coordinate Systems\n",
    "Before we start, it is important to understand the different coordinate systems at play here. The TLEs and the SGP4 propagator are closely intertwined, and both are expected to operate _solely_ in what is known as the __TEME (True Equator Mean Equinox)__ coordinate system.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, for most intents and purposes, we require the __ITRF (International Terrestrial Reference Frame)__, which is a specification of an __ECEF (Earth-Centered Earth-Fixed)__ frame. This conversion from TEME to ITRF is _non-trivial_, and is the part which requires a lot of external input i.e. not just the TLE, but other things known as Earth Orientation Parameters are required.\n",
    "\n",
    "See [this reference](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA637370.pdf) for a great discussion on the different coordinate frames."

    "Clearly, there is a slight difference here, on the order of about 10m (0.01km). This is more than likely to be good enough, but why is it different if ```skyfield``` is only wrapping ```sgp4```? It turns out there's a simple explanation for this, which is pretty obvious looking at the code; ```skyfield``` defaults to using WGS72, and doesn't have an option to specify this in ```EarthSatellite()``` directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that it is _not at all obvious_ that the wrapper function ```Satrec.twoline2rv()``` takes in an optional parameter for the gravitational constant. It is apparent if you have looked at the original C++ code, which has an argument ```gravconsttype whichconst```, but otherwise since the python ```sgp4``` library wraps it and exposes an interface without good docstrings, the only documentation that shows this is at the PyPi site [here](https://pypi.org/project/sgp4/), scrolling down to the 'Gravity' section. Notably, it does claim that using WGS84 at this point in the propagator is likely to perform worse when compared to real measurements of satellite positions, due to the TLEs being generated with WGS72 models in mind."
